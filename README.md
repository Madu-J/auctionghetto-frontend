- Open your IDE program and launch the terminal.
- Type git clone and paste the copied URL from step 3.
- Press Enter, and the local clone of the project will be created.
- Go to the project repository.
- Click the green button that says "Gitpod" to open the project in Gitpod.

* Deploying with Heroku

- To deploy your project using Heroku, follow the steps below based on the Code Institute tutorial:
- In the Gitpod CLI, run the following command to create the necessary files for Heroku to install project dependencies:
- pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt

- Note: Make sure to add the requirements.txt file to your .gitignore file to prevent it from being committed.
- Visit Heroku.com and log in. If you don't have an account, you will need to create one.
